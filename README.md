# CodeGPT
A research project at NCSU.

Even though a series of codes can achieve the same functions, their differences in composition and algorithm make them different in execution efficiency.

Recently, OpenAI has released an AI-powered language model called ChatGPT, which can understand human language and answer questions. With its suggestions, we aim to optimize code performance more efficiently.

In our project, we developed a website based on open-source APIs to display and revise code from Internet. LSP (Language Server Protocol) integrated in our code editor will implement support for finding all references and locating function body on focus, and thus to identify specific functions that require to be optimized.

After accomplishing the development stage, we applied it to open-source code to evaluate and improve the web page experience and to optimize the performance of the programming code.
